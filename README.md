## Greetings, fellow human. ðŸ¤˜

While most of my work has moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/andyscott/), I continue to use GitHub for PR forks and other conveniences. Feel free to reach out here or on Codeberg if you'd like to collaborate.

While you'll have to click through the above link to find my recent work, please enjoy this silly (yet fancy) [Holopin board](https://www.holopin.io) from [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) 2024!
